# Troubleshooting

Discover IPs of the 4 router interfaces

    | host |-------| router |-------| router |------| host |

1. Packet capture
	* CDP
	* Routing protocol
		* Learn about networks that exist elsewhere
		* Get closest router IP as well
	* ARP
	* DHCP
	* services
2. host routing table
3. IP address
4. traceroute

# Project Manager

* The PM must also:
	* manage people
	* anticipate problems
	* utilize resources effectively
	* glue everything together
* Organized approach to thought processes and actions

# Project

A group of inter-dependent activities that require people and resources with defined dates 

* PM institute - PM body of knowledge
* goal - exactly what needs to be accomplished
* scope - documented set of standards and criteria that the customer defines as successful completion
* objective - combination of tasks that concern specific functional groups or structural areas
* tasks - list of activities that lead to the achievement of definable result or deliverable
* activity - time consuming piece of work with a definite beginning and end
* duration - elapsed time of these components

* Project
	* Objective 1
		* Task 1
			* Activity 1
			* Activity 2
		* Task 2
			* Activity 1
			* Activity 2
			* Activity 3
	* Objective 2

* Network build
	* Design
	* Construction
		* Cable plan
			* Running cable
			* TTT (tone, terminate and test)
		* Routing and switching infrastructure
		* HVAC
		* Power
		* Wireless
		* Servers

# Constraint

* a good PM must understand the lists of their resources
* a couple of views
	* Project depends on cost, schedule, quality
	* quality is determined by cost, time and scope
	* AKA finances, time, human resources
* quality may actually become a fourth constraint
* these are your limiting factors
* constraints usually compete
	* cannot change 1 without affecting the others
* good PM 
	* works with them
	* can I turn this to my advantage?
