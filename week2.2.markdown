# Stuff we're doing to measure

##  Crosstalk

* many types
	* NEXT
	* FEXT
	* ELFEXT
* signal interference from an adjacent pair or cable that adversely affects the data speed (not necessarily adjacent)
* basically unwanted signal
* problems typically get worse as frequency increases
* NEXT - difference between test signal and the crosstalk
	* higher is better
* FEXT - difference between test signal and crosstalk at the far end
* ELFEXT - equal level FEXT
	* difference between FEXT and attenuation
	* important because FEXT is additive

## Attenuation

Tendency of a signal to degrade over time and distance

* lower is better

## Reflections (AKA return)

Portion (or all) of the test signal is bounced back to the sender

* difference value (usually)
* you do **not** want to return less
* opens - same amplitude and polarity
* shorts - same amplitude, opposite polarity
