# Project Management

Why?
* Number of projects running within an org
* The rate at which they must be completed
* Competition
* Handling all of the issues associated with completion
* technology rate of change
* shorter product lifespans
* fewer people, more work
* pm skills -> more marketable
* tight schedules

## History / Techniques

### WWI & Gantt charts
* bar chart showing schedule and progress
* comprised of terminal elements and summary elements
* can show dependencies
* can become cluttered

### Critical Path Method
* algorithm based
* list of activities, time and dependencies
* the **critical path** is the set of activities with the longest duration and the shortest possible

### Program Evaluation & Review Program (PERT)
* event-oriented rather than start/end
* PERT charts help you make decisions by linking events with activities

One of the most important contributions that a PM can bring is guidance. This keeps worry to a minimum.

Guidance is often in the form of providing a schedule of small, easily managed tasks.
